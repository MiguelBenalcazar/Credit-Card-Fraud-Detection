Credit Card Fraud Detection Deep Learning Model: Deep Neural Network

In this homework, Dataset from Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection is utilized to 
build classification models. The datasets were already preprocessed. The features V1,
V2, ..., and V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features
which have not been transformed with PCA are ’Time’ and ’Amount.’ Feature ’Time’
contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the
dataset. The feature ’Amount’ is the transaction Amount. Feature ’Class’ is the label,
and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
